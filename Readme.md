# Jpeg/Mpeg Compression

This is a C# project which performs compression using H.261

### What does it do?
A program written in C# to read pixel array data from .bmp and performs the following:
* Subsampling
* DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)
* Quantization
* Run Length Encoding
* Compression
* Run Length Encoding
* Dequantization
* Inverse DCT
* Inverse subsampling

All methods are performed to reduce the storage size of the image.
